The orthography is based on Zaikov (2013): *Vienankarjalan kielioppi* ISBN: 978-951-97551-7-5, although lexical data is also harvested from [Karjalan kielen sanakirja](http://kaino.kotus.fi/cgi-bin/kks/karjala.cgi) and practical needs of parsing corpora, i.e. just accepting other dialects on the continuum up-to Livvi/olonets karelian language.
